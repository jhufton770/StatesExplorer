How to Use this App
===================
The adjacent side panel has several options for plotting the diamond related data.  Selecting any of them modifies the data plot contained in the adjacent "Plot" tab.

Plotting Controls
---------------------
The selector controls available to modify the characteristics of the data plot are:

*	X: Selects the data item to be plotted on the X-axis (available choices are State and Region).
*	Y: Selects the data item to be plotted on the Y-axis (see the About this Dataset tab for  more details on the available choices).
*	Color: Available when State is chosen as the X-axis, Color selects another data item to color the state bars which allows a combination of two data items to be visualized. As an example, choosing Population as the Y-axis and showing the relationship between Population and another data item like LifeExpectancy, the value of which is represented by the color used for drawing a state's bar in the plot.
*	Sort by Y: Allows the barplots to be sorted by the data item chosen for the Y-axis.  Sorting is only provided when State is chosen as the X-axis value.
	*	Sort options are:
		*	No Sort: Bars are sorted by state abbreviation.
		*	Ascending: Bars are sorted by the values of the Y-axis data.
		*	Descending: Bars are reverse sorted by the values of the Y-axis data.
		
Suggestions
-----------

*	For best viewing, expand the horizontal dimension of the application window to more easily view the text of the state abbreviations along the X-axis when plotting State as the X-axis variable.
*	Coloring by Region facilitates a comparison by region as well as an individual state by state comparison.
